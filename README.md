# Spirefy Plugin Generator For Go

This plugin adds a Go Plugin generator to the [Plugin Generator](https://github.com/spirefy/plugin-generator/) new tab</a> plugin extension point. This
allows the plugin generator to now build plugin projects in Go so that Go developers
can quickly generate a plugin project ready to build and work with the Plugin Engine
and Extism WASM plugin capability.
